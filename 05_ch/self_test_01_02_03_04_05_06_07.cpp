/*
	1) 
	In the first case we are declaring an array of base type int that
	has 5 elements. The second is simply refering to the fifth array variable.
	In this case the last variable in our array since the maximum index
	is 4.

	2)
	a) score
	b) double
	c) 5
	d) From 0 to 4
	e) score[3]

	3)
	a) 
	The number of elements that is being assigned to the array exceeds 
	the declared size of the array (in this case 4)

	b)
	I don't see any error here

	c)
	I don't see any error here

	4)
	abc

	5)
	1.1 2.2 3.3
	1.1 3.3 3.3

	6)
	0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18
	0 4 8 12 16

	7)
	Because the for loop ranges the index variable from 1 to 10 (instead of 0 to 9)
	we end up using an illegal index value for our array. In this case the illegal index
	value is 10 since the biggest index of our array of size 10 is 9.
