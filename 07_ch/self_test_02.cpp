	// 	constructors that have been included by ourselves, then
	// 	a default constructor is generated automatically. If the
	// 	class that we generated has constructors then the default
	// 	constructor is not generated automatically and is our job
	// 	to include one.

	// 	In this way, there can be a class that has
	// 	constructors of at leas one parameter, but no default constructor.
	// 	Therefore, not every class has a default constructor.
