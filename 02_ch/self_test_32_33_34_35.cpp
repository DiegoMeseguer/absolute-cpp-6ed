		This seems like a way of implementing the log function
		using a for loop.

		But because of the semi-colon, the for loop has an empty body
		that is going to be iterated 9(or 10?) times, then log gets incremented
		one time and we have a final cout statement.
	33)
		In this case we have an infinite loop because the boolean expression
		inside our for loop is never false

		b) while loop
		c) while loop
		d) do while
